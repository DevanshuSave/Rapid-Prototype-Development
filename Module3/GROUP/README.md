Creative portion details: For the creative portion, we tried making the website a bit more appealing with some different CSS stylings. Furthermore, we created and implemented a "like/dislike" feature for our stories. Finally, we allowed a user to specify a "type" or topic for their story when creating the post. To best utilize this feature, we included links on our website that would take users to a page where only stories of the desired type would be shown.
